a9_011719:
- Recommended filesystem is 011719
- Minimum A6 firmware is 011717/1.6
- Persistent guard crossing with keep alive
- Usbtmc
- Lots of GUI changes
- Scope infrastructure

a9_121918:
- Recommended filesystem is 121818 
- Minimum A6 firmware is 082818/1.51
- Recompiled all processes and libraries with Sumo
- Target now has only Python 3

a9_120618:
- Recommended filesystem is 091418
- Minimum A6 firmware is 082818/1.51
- Includes new GUI using QML
- Additional Opman support for current and power
- State support for temperature functions (not in Opman yet)
- Reduced polling from Opman and delays in busy loops to improve
  performance
- System settings module
- Added mutex to jsonrpc connectors
- Go to standby on all function changes

a9_092818:
- Minimum A6 firmware is 082818/1.51
- Additional fixes for high voltage AC. Some concerns still exist
  about the 330V range boundary.

a9_092618:
- Minimum A6 firmware is 082818/1.51
- *** For use with Proto C A7 ***
- ACV - reverted to full frequency 330V AC range
- Initial pass at temperature functions, more work to be done.

a9_091918:
- Minimum A6 firmware is 082818/1.51
- ACV - between 110V and 330V with > 10 kHz frequency should now
  select the 330V range. Above 330V with <= 10 kHZ frequency should
  now select the 1020V range.
- Fix for segmentation fault in GUI.
- Resistance should be functioning again.
- Some tweaks to the Qwidgets implementation of setup.
- Partial AC Power functionality in Opman.
- Partial DC Power functionality in Opman.
- Lows open/tied in DC & AC Power.

a9_083018:
- Minimum A6 firmware is 082818/1.51
- High voltage ranges now call correct sequences for DCV and ACV
- All initialization sequences should run, even if there is a prior
  failure or board missing.
- The SEQ? command in the remote interface is now SEQ without the
  question mark.
- The GUI should start automatically on power up.
Known Issues:
- Some performance related issues were observed on Dave's system.
  Notably, remote commands issued via telnet seemed a bit slow and a
  keytest application was observed to be slow. There was some hardware
  swapping that occurred and the problem seems to have gone away.
  Please report any similar instances.
- A segmentation fault was observed within the GUI, but this seems to
  only occur if the GUI is started independently from the other
  modules. The fault appeared sporadically, so please try to document
  the steps you took prior to observing the fault condition.

a9_082818:
- Minimum A6 firmware is 082818/1.51
- 1st release on rev3 a9
- includes guard crossing changes:
  - Seq downloaded to inguard
  - Reg downloaded to outguard
Known Issues:
- High voltage ranges not calling correct sequences
