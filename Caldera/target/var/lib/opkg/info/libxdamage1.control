Version: 1:1.1.4-r0
Description: Xdamage: X Damage extension library
 'Damage' is a term that describes changes make to pixel contents of
 windows and pixmaps.  Damage accumulates as drawing occurs in the
 drawable.  Each drawing operation 'damages' one or more rectangular areas
 within the drawable.  The rectangles are guaranteed to include the set of
 pixels modified by each operation, but may include significantly more
 than just those pixels.  The DAMAGE extension allows applications to
 either receive the raw rectangles as a stream of events, or to have them
 partially processed within the X server to reduce the amount of data
 transmitted as well as reduce the processing latency once the repaint
 operation has started.
