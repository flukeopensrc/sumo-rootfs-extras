Description: Avahi IPv4LL network address configuration daemon
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery. It
 allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a
 local network with no specific configuration. This tool implements
 IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses" (IETF
 RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address configuration from the
 link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the need for a central server.
