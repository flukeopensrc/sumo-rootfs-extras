Description: A System and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with SysV
 and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
 capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
 offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
 maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate
 transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
